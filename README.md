Preface
=============================

Just as 'Hello World' for the language, We got 'BLOG' for the life. 
<cite>[Willeave Shakesfear][]</cite>

After 2 years, I finally realized I need a place to archive the daily thoughts and achievements.
As I remembered, I developed a stupid BLOG project in my git repo before, so I cloned it and tried to do some modify.
But WTF is this design? What I was thinking two years ago?
I could image the face of the interviewer when he open this blog, as I mentioned this one in my resume.

So here we go, cd BASE_DIR, rm -rf, and start the stuff from the beginning. 

And here is what I need in this project:

* Try best to reuse the code.
* Do thing in easy way.
* Lazy and Smart.
* The BLOG is for yourself, not others.

Ok, then see myself in the code.
